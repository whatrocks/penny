For this project, we'd like you to implement an app or widget to visually present some of the data provided.  It's up to you as to what data you'd like to present.  There are no penalties for presenting just one data point, and no bonus points for presenting all the data.  Obviously, your app must have at least one data visualization. 

We do want to emphasize that we will be evaluating your app based on its ability to fully fullfill a complete user use-case and will be asking for documentation on the user's journey through your app.  It's up to you who your user is and what their particular use case will be.  Feel free to be as creative as you want in this regard.  However, if you need some inspiration, you can think of your user as a fellow developer (maybe you in the future) who has been woken up at 2am by pingdom and needs to understand why he/she has been woken up.

# Project Purpose

As a team we are evaluating candidates based on these team values:
* Technical capabilities to complete the task and produce stable code.
* Understanding of known risks and benefits of various technical or UX decisions taken.
* Communication
* Ability to narrow project's scope to a manageable level.

# Requirements

- User-friendly interface

# Deliverables

We expect to receive a git repository containing the following:

* The source code of the application visually present the data set
* Instructions on how to run the application locally
* A short description of who your user is, and what user need your app is fulfilling.

# If you have questions
We think this project is purposely vague and completely understand if you have questions.  Feel free to contact anyone on the ai team (caio.casmiro@konghq.com, amy.wang@konghq.com) with any questions you have.  You are welcome ask anything you want related to the project. There are no penalties for asking questions.
